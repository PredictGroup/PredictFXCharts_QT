<p class="heading1aa">Formats Available for This Documentation</p><div class="content">
This documentation is available in both CHM and HTML formats. CHM is the recommended format on Windows because of the built-in search facilities and better indexing support in CHM viewers, while HTML format can be read on any operating system. Both formats may be downloaded from <a href="http://www.advsofteng.com/download.html" target="_top">http://www.advsofteng.com/download.html</a>.<br><br>
<div style="background-color:#cccccc;width:99%;padding:10px">
Due to security reasons, Microsoft Windows may only view CHM files properly if they are located on the local hard disk. CHM files located on network drives may not work properly. Please ensure the CHM file is copied to your local hard disk for reading.<br><br>
Also, if the CHM file is downloaded from the Internet or copied from a network drive (as opposed to installed by an installer), Microsoft Windows may block the CHM file. You may need to "unblock" the CHM to read it. The steps are:<br><br>
<ul style="margin-bottom:0px"> <li>Right-click the CHM file, and then click Properties. <li>Click Unblock, then click OK. </ul>
