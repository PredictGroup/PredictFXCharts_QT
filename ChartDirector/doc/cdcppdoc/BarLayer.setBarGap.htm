<div class="content">
void setBarGap(double barGap, double subBarGap = 0.2);
</div>
<p class="heading2">Description</p>
<div class="content">
Sets the gap between the bars in a bar chart layer.<br><br>
In the setBarGap method, the gap between the bars is expressed as the portion of the space between the bars. For example, a bar gap of 0.2 means 20% of the distance between two adjacent bars is the gap between the bars.<br><br>
A bar gap of 0 means there is no gap in between the bars. The bar gap can be negative. In this case, the bars will overlap. The predefined constant <a href="Chart.TouchBar.htm">TouchBar</a> ( = -1.7E-100) means the bars will "touch", that is, the bar borders overlap, so two adjacent bars will share the same border.<br><br>
For multi-bar layers (bar layers using the <a href="Chart.Side.htm">Side</a> data combine method, or for stacked bar layers with multiple data groups), <b>barGap</b> refers to the portion of the space between bar groups, while <b>subBarGap</b> refers to the portion of the space between bars within the bar group.
