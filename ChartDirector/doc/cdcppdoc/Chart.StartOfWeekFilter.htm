<div class="content">
int StartOfWeekFilter(int labelStep = 1, double initialMargin = 0.05);
</div>
<p class="heading2">Description</p>
<div class="content">
Creates a data filter that matches date/times that represent the start of a new week in a date/time series.<br><br>
This method is typically used in <a href="Axis.setMultiFormat.htm">Axis.setMultiFormat</a> and <a href="Axis.setMultiFormat2.htm">Axis.setMultiFormat2</a> to select specific dates/times for formatting as axis labels.<br><br>
In a date/time series, an element is considered that start of a new week if it is of a different week than the previous element. It does not need to be at exactly the starting instance of the week.<br><br>
For the first element of the date/time series, because there is no previous element to compare with, it will be considered as the start of a new week if it is "near" the exact starting instance of the current week, in which "near" is defined using the <b>initialMargin</b> argument, expressed as a ratio (0 to 1) of the week duration.
